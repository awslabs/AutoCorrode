text\<open>By default, a new isabelle \<^verbatim>\<open>datatype\<close> with \<^verbatim>\<open>n\<close> constructors will generate \<^verbatim>\<open>n \<times> (n - 1)\<close> 
elimination rules of the form \<^term>\<open>ConstructorI = ConstructorJ \<Longrightarrow> R\<close> with \<^term>\<open>i \<noteq> j\<close>. This
quadratic scaling leads to performance issues in Isabelle2025, which has been reported on the
mailing list \<^url>\<open>https://isabelle.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/247541-Mirror.3A-Isabelle-Users-Mailing-List/topic/.5Bisabelle.5D.20Merging.20elimination.20rules.20of.20Claset.20is.20slow.20-.20.2E.2E.2E/near/525149986\<close>

Moreover, the rules are are superfluous in some sense, since \<^verbatim>\<open>simp\<close> will also prove such goals
without the elimination rule, by simplifying \<^term>\<open>(ConstructorI = ConstructorJ) = False\<close>.

There is currently no native way to disable the generation of these elimination rules.
As a temporary stopgap, this file adds a new \<^verbatim>\<open>datatype\<close> plugin, which removes the elimination
rules from a newly generated \<^verbatim>\<open>datatype\<close> directly after they have been generated.\<close>
