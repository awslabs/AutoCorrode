# Micro Rust parsing frontend

This directory contains material related to parsing of Micro Rust expressions.
Note that this material is completely syntactic, and independent of any
semantics that we may imbue Micro Rust constructs with.  To perform a batch
build of all theories, and generate PDF documentation, invoke:

```shell
λ> $ISABELLE_HOME/bin/isabelle build -D .
```

To edit interactively, use:

```shell
λ> $ISABELLE_HOME/bin/isabelle jedit *.thy &
```
