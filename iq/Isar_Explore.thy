       It appears that we have to use the provided execution ID to run the transition.
       This ID however seems stable across multiple overlays.

       In the rare case that the transition execution produces direct error output, we
       need to retain overlay specific position information _and_ avoid the output to be
       attributed to the parent command. We achieve this by using a dummy file name and
       encode the overlay instance ID in it.

       This is matched against in Extended_Query_Operation.scala.

       The only known case where this is needed is when transition execution forks off threads
       for the execution of `by ...` statements. We explicitly disable this one below with the
       thread-unsafe hack. With this, the dummy file assignment should not be necessary, but
       we leave it in just in case.
